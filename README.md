# Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing has responsibility for the Backend of the application and is responsible for the Google Cloud Platform.

# Create an API for Backend
Responsible for application backend features by creating REST APIs using node.js. We use express.js as framework to make REST API. We also use Postman for API testing and documentation.

# Deploying API that already created to Google Cloud Platform
We deploy our API that already we created before on Google Cloud Platform. On the Google Cloud platform itself we also use several services provided by the Google Cloud Platform
1. Google Cloud Storage Bucket as the cloud storage that we use
2. Google Cloud SQL as a database in the applications we have created
3. Google App Engine as a service to deploy the API that we had created previously. Here is the endpoint link of our API: <a href=https://simpeapi.et.r.appspot.com> API Endpoint</a>
